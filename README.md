## Recomendations

Create a commit for every step that you do. We will be easier for us understand what you are doing and what are you thinking.

We recommend use TDD, if you don't know, don't worry, you could test at the end, and if you don't know how to test, don't worry, it is fine.

We highly recommend use all your knowledgemnt of Object Oriented Software Design and good development practises.

Good luck and enjoy!
